What I created:

    1.) A list of products that users can buy
    2.) Functions to enable typical shopping cart functions including:
                * Adding an item to a cart
                * Increasing or decreasing the quantity of an item
                * Removing an item
                * Adding up the cost of all items in the cart
                * Paying for the items
